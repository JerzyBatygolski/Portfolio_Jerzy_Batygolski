# Portfolio Jerzy Batygolski

Hello, this is portfolio of my programming projects. Let's check it out :)

## GUI applications

1. Traffic simulation with GUI, written in C++ in OOP paradigm. The main aim is to mimic real traffic with smoothness of car movements including collision avoidance.
Tech stack: Visual Studio C++, classical mechanics

## Embedded systems

2. Cubic dice randomness tester - electronic circuit design with ATmega328P microprocessor. If you play boardgames with friends, you can check if you had luck or bad and saw statistics of your rolls.
Tech stack: Arduino, soldered electronic circuits

## Physics

3. Simulation of an ideal gas in a box. We can see how 10 000 of particles, starting from random initail positions and orientations, but having the same magnitudes of velocities, reaches the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of speeds. If we add gravity and temperature gradient (e.g. heating at the bottom and cooling at the top), the particles tend to self-organize and start to move in a convection roll.
Tech stack: C, Wolfram Mathematica, Matlab, kinetic theory, statistical physics

4. Simulation of an Ising-doped voter model on a square lattice. The simulation was a part of my scientific paper in Physical Review:
https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.105.064120
Tech stack: C, Wolfram Mathematica, Matlab, Linux

## Robotics

5. Two-wheeled mobile robot controlled from a smartphone app.
Tech stack: Arduino, Bluetooth, MIT App Inventor 2, electronic circuits

## Industrial automation

6. Simulation of an apple juice factory in a Codesys software. Code wtitten in ST language on Astraada PLC.  
Tech stack: Codesys, ST, PLC, thermodynamics
